                    Punjab, India. The museum celebrates 500 years of the Sikh history and the 300th anniversary of the
                    birth of Khalsa, based on the scriptures written by the tenth and last human guru, Guru Gobind Singh
                    Ji. It serves to attract tourists and pilgrims. This results in a consultation between religion and
                    emerging need in the building environment. One side it promotes hand crafts to locals as well as
                    nurturing a sense of heritage, besides it recalls to infinity by the volumetric interference of
                    existing skyline is another phase of a visible Urbanism dilemma.
