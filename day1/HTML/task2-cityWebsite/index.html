                        <p>Anandpur Sahib, also referred simply as Anandpur (lit. "city of bliss"), is a city in
                            Rupnagar district (Ropar), on the edge of Shivalik Hills, in the Indian state of Punjab.
                            Located near the Sutlej River, the city is one of the most sacred religious places in
                            Sikhism, being the place where the last two Sikh Gurus, Guru Tegh Bahadur and Guru Gobind
                            Singh, lived. It is also the place where Guru Gobind Singh founded the Khalsa Panth in
                            1699. The city is home to Takhat Sri Kesgarh Sahib, the third of the five Takhts in
                            Sikhism.

                            The city is a pilgrimage site in Sikhism. It is the venue of the largest annual Sikh
                            gathering and festivities during the Hola Mohalla in the spring season.

                            Anandpur Sahib was founded in June 1665 by the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur. He
                            previously lived in Kiratpur, but given the disputes with Ram Rai â€“ the elder son of Guru
                            Har Rai and other sects of Sikhism, he moved to village in Makhoval. He named it Chakk
                            Nanaki after his mother.In 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur was tortured and beheaded for
                            refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, a martyrdom
                            that led Sikhs to rename the town to Anandpur and crown his son Gobind Das as per his orders
                            (also known as Gobind Rai) as his successor and famous as Guru Gobind Singh.

                            Anandpur Sahib is in Punjab state of India, close to the Himachal Pradesh border. It is about 31 kilometres (19 mi) north of Ropar (Rupnagar) and 29 kilometres (18 mi) south of Nangal.[5] The gurdwaras of Anandpur are classified as historical since they are connected to the Sikh gurus or other aspects related to the history of Sikhism.[3] The architecture of the Sikh shrines of Anandpur have commonalities in their themes but also have unique quirks and aspects to their design that do set them apart from each-other.[3] Anandpur has been significant to the Sikh history
