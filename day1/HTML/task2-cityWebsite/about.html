        Anandpur Sahib was founded in June 1665 by the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur. He previously lived in
        Kiratpur, but given the disputes with Ram Rai – the elder son of Guru Har Rai and other sects of Sikhism, he
        moved to village in Makhoval. He named it Chakk Nanaki after his mother.[6] In 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur was
        tortured and beheaded for refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, a
        martyrdom that led Sikhs to rename the town to Anandpur and crown his son Gobind Das as per his orders (also
        known as Gobind Rai)[7] as his successor and famous as Guru Gobind Singh.[8][9][10]
    </p>
    The village grew into town, likely dramatically state Louis E. Fenech and W. H. McLeod, as Sikhs moved near Guru
    Gobind Singh.[8] The growing strength of Sikhs in Anandpur under the tenth Guru, after the execution of the
    ninth Guru, raised concerns of the neighboring Pahari rajas - the vassals of the Mughal Empire, along with the
    Mughal ruler Aurangzeb.[8][11]: 14  In 1693, Aurangzeb issued an order that banned large gatherings of Sikhs
    such as during the festival of Baisakhi.[11]: 14 
    <p>
        On the Vaisakhi day of 1699, the Guru sent out invitations across the land to distant and nearby Sikh
        congregations to convene at Anandpur for the upcoming festival.[3] It was normal for the Guru to celebrate
        Vaisakhi at Anandpur with Sikh congregations annually but this time much more importance was placed on
        attendance than usual and more stringently.[3] Guru Gobind Singh founded the Khalsa Panth in Anandpur on the day
        of the 1699 Vaisakhi festival after an elaborate ceremony and gathered a large armed militia.[3] This triggered
        Aurangzeb and his vassal Hindu kings around Anandpur to blockade Anandpur.[8] This led to several battles:
    </p>
    First Battle of Anandpur (1700), against the Mughal army of Aurangzeb, who had sent 10,000 soldiers under the
    command of Painda Khan and Dina Beg.[12] In a direct combat between Guru Gobind Singh and Painda Khan, the
    latter was killed. His death led to the Mughal army fleeing the battlefield.[12]
    Second Battle of Anandpur (1704), against the Mughal army led first by Saiyad Khan and then by Ramjan Khan;[12]
    The Mughal general was fatally wounded by Sikh soldiers, and the army withdrew. Aurangzeb then sent a larger
    army with two generals, Wazir Khan and Zaberdast Khan in May 1704, to destroy the Sikh resistance.[12] The
    approach the Mughal army took in this battle was to lay a protracted siege against Anandpur, from May to
    December, cutting off all food and other supplies moving in and out, along with repeated battles.[13] Some Sikh
    men deserted the Guru during Anandpur siege in 1704, and escaped to their homes where their women shamed them
    and they rejoined the Guru's army and died fighting with him in 1705.[14][15] Towards the end, the Guru, his
    family and followers accepted an offer by Aurangzeb of safe passage out of Anandpur.[16] However, as they left
    Anandpur in two batches, they were attacked, and one of the batches with Mata Gujari and Guru's two sons –
    Zorawar Singh aged 8 and Fateh Singh aged 5 – were taken captive by the Mughal army.[17][18] Both his children
    were executed by burying them alive into a wall.[13][19] The grandmother Mata Gujari died there as well.[17]
    According to Louis Fenech, Anandpur's history during the late 17th century and early 18th century was complex
    and war prone because the relationship of Guru Gobind Singh with his neighbors was complex. Sometimes the hill
    chiefs and Guru Gobind Singh cooperated in a battle, sometimes they fought against each other, where the
    difficult mountainous terrain made it difficult for the Mughal to subdue everyone with force and the terrain
    made it easier for Pahari chieftains to rebel against the Mughals routinely.[11]: 8–11 
    <p>
        After the city was sacked in 1704, its control passed into the hands of Budh Singh, a disciple of Guru Gobind
        Singh.[6] Budh Singh later handed over control of the city over to Patiala State under the reign of Ala
        Singh.[6] In 1764, the descendent of Sodhi Suraj Mal (one of the sons of Guru Hargobind), Nahar Singh, purchased
        the city plus a fort called Manji Sahib (which was a dwelling associated with Suraj Mal).[6] As more Sodhi
        families moved into the city, four Sarkars were established, with them namely being: Badi, Dusri, Tisri, and
        Chauthi.[6] The Badi sarkar was the most eminent of the four yet all of them were revered by the Sikh population
        of the era.[6] Each sarkar had its own associated palace that was fortified, commune, and congregation of
        followers.[6] The sarkars also maintained a militia of their own, consisting of infantry, cavalary, and
        elephants.[6]

        Virasat-e-Khalsa Museum campus links, particularly with the need of the population, providing business to the
        locals and makes the city marked on urban literature globally. Punjab Heritage Tourism Promotion Board paid to
        have it installed in order to attract worldwide tourism. Open spaces which are going to be used by ritual
        activities during ceremonies and festivals also serve as alternative parking grounds, reserved grounds for
        political rallies which brings the intact ingredient of Indian cities together “The Interaction”.
